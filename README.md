_Last Update : 08-18-2024_

## Overview

Taskly is a simple yet effective to-do app designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This project was created by **Souleimane El Qodsi** in the context of learning **FlutterFlow** through a guided step-by-step tutorial. This app is purely fictional and was developed as an educational exercise. Taskly is open source and not subject to any copyright restrictions.

## Learning Context

This project was developed as part of a guided learning experience using the following FlutterFlow tutorial series:

### Key Notes:
- Taskly is not intended for commercialization.
- The design and functionality heavily rely on the tutorial, with additional features and enhancements added by me.
- The project is open source, and contributions or forks are welcome.

## Features

Taskly offers basic task management features, all built entirely using FlutterFlow with Firebase as the backend. Below are the main features included in this version (v2) of the app:

- **User Authentication:**
  - Sign up with email
  - Login with email
  - Password recovery
  - Email verification
  - Profile management (update profile picture, name, and birthday)
  - **Modern Transitions:** Smooth transitions have been incorporated in the Sign Up and Onboarding pages to enhance user experience.

- **Task Management:**
  - Add tasks with descriptions
  - Edit existing tasks
  - Mark tasks as complete
  - Uncheck completed tasks to return them to the task list

- **Profile Management:**
  - Update profile information, including profile picture, name, and birthday
  - Log out of the account
  - Change password
  - Delete account

### Upcoming Features (v3)
This is just the beginning! Taskly is currently at version 2 (v2), and I plan to add more features in future updates, including (among others):
- Task deletion
